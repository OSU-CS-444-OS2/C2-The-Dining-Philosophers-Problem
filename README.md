# C2-The-Dining-Philosophers-Problem

Write concurrent code which implements a solution which satisfies the above description. A few important details:


  Each bowl of noodles is infinite.


  Eating takes a random amount of time in the range of 2-9 seconds.


  Thinking takes a random amount of time in the range of 1-20 seconds.


  You must have output that makes sense, and shows the correctness of your solution.


  This includes the status of all forks at all times.


  The status of each philosopher, as well.


  You are welcome to name your philosophers whatever you want, so long as they are named after real people.


  Use whatever synchronization construct you feel is appropriate.


  While you are not constrained to any given language, it is required to run on os-class. There is an (older) installation of mono on os-class in /scratch/bin (--prefix=/scratch, for reference). In other words, C#, C++, C, python, ruby, perl, etc. are all usable. That said, your program *must* truly run concurrently!


  Parallelism is also up to you. pthreads, C++threads, Boost.Thread, OpenMP, Intel TBB, whatever. It's all up to you. Again, just make sure it runs on os-class.
